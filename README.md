# Algorithms and Data structures
Here are algorithmes and data structures which I implemented for one of my subjects in my Uni.
There is also a directory with reports about their speed, complexity, etc. All reports are written in Polish.
## Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble sort
2. Heap sort
3. Counting sort
4. Shell sort
5. Quick sort
6. Merge sort

## Lists and Trees
1. List
2. Binary Tree
3. AVL Tree

## Graphs
1. Adjacency matrix
2. Incidence matrix
3. Edge list
4. Adjacency lists
5. Directed acyclic graph
